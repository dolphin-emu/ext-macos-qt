This is the subset of Qt on which Dolphin relies for development and
distribution tasks.

Note that this subset only supports building and deploying Dolphin. If you 
want
the full Qt development toolset, you will need to install them separately.

This version is built using https://github.com/OatmealDome/qsc and the 
manifest
files included in this repository.
